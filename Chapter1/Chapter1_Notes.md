# Chapter 1 Notes and discussion

Data collection
We will use data from a large national survey that was designed explicitly with the
goal of generating statistically valid inferences about the U.S. population.

Descriptive statistics
We will generate statistics that summarize the data concisely, and evaluate different
ways to visualize data.

Exploratory data analysis
We will look for patterns, differences, and other features that address the questions
we are interested in. At the same time we will check for inconsistencies and identify
limitations.

Estimation
We will use data from a sample to estimate characteristics of the general population.

Hypothesis testing
Where we see apparent effects, like a difference between two groups, we will evaluate
whether the effect might have happened by chance.
